            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change. 
Version control systems are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. I recently worked an internship and we used Github to collaborate on projects. It made the flow of information easy and helped with tracking and reversing changes. Knowing what changes were made, who made the changes, and when the changes were made helped with comparing versions. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 
Copying a repository from one user's account to another is called forking. This lets you take a project that you don't have access to and modify it under your own account. If you want to officially change the project you can send a notification, a pull request, to the original owner The user can then merge the changes found in your repository with the original repository. These three features are the reasons why so many tech geeks prefer to use GitHub. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Backup Files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In computing the phrase backup means to copy files to a second medium (a disk or tape) as a precaution in case the first medium fails. One of the cardinal rules in using computers is back up your files regularly. 
Many professionals recommend that you make two, or even three, backups of all your files. To be especially safe, you should keep one backup in a different location from the others. You can backup files using operating system commands, or you can buy a special-purpose backup utility. Backup programs often compress thedataso that backups require fewer disks. The command in GitHub is github-backup, which backs up everything github knows about a repository, to the repository.

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The local repository refers to a copy on your own installation that is a cache of the remote downloads, and also contains the temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released. Remote repositories refer to any other type of repository, accessed by a variety of protocols such as file:// and http://. Git init creates a local repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty repository. Most of the other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you’ll run in a new project. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more. To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command. It lists the short names of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin.</p>
